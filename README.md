# Synthetic Data Generation for Rare Defects using ControlNet

# Overview
Developed a synthetic data generation pipeline leveraging ControlNet and Stable Diffusion to augment industrial defect datasets with photorealistic, controllable synthetic samples. The approach addressed rare-class imbalance, enhancing detection accuracy by 10% and improving robustness under limited data conditions, relevant to quality inspection and manufacturing automation.

# Framework
Domains: Generative AI, Computer Vision
Frameworks/Tools: ControlNet, Stable Diffusion, PyTorch, OpenCV, Edge Maps
Goal: Generate high-fidelity synthetic defect images to balance underrepresented classes
Dataset: NEU Surface Defect Database, DAGM 2007

# Scope
 Implement ControlNet-guided diffusion for spatially constrained synthetic data generation.
 Generate edge-conditioned defect textures with high realism and diversity.
 Use synthetic–real hybrid training for model robustness enhancement.
 Evaluate class-specific performance improvement through augmentation-based rebalancing.

# Methodology
 1. Data Preprocessing

 Extracted edge maps via Canny + Sobel for structural conditioning.
 Normalized and resized images to 512×512 resolution.
 Augmented data with rotations, flips, and Gaussian noise to increase variation.

 2. ControlNet Conditioning

 Base model: Stable Diffusion v1.5 fine-tuned with ControlNet (edge map conditioning).
 Conditioning input: Edge map (structure) + Text prompt (defect type).
 Generated synthetic samples for rare defect categories (e.g., inclusion, crack, rolled-in scale).

 3. Model Integration

 Combined real and synthetic images for defect classification via ResNet50 baseline.
 Trained using balanced sampling and weighted loss.
 Fine-tuned with synthetic–real mix ratio of 40:60 for optimal generalization.

 4. Evaluation

 Metrics: F1-score, Precision, Recall, Accuracy.
 Baselines: Real-only training vs. Hybrid synthetic–real training.

# Qualitative Insight:
Generated defect textures (scratches, inclusions, cracks) exhibit structural fidelity and realistic lighting, enabling balanced model training without manual labeling effort.

# Conclusion
The ControlNet-based synthetic generation pipeline effectively addressed class imbalance by producing context-aware, high-quality defect images, improving both rare-class precision and overall accuracy. The method demonstrates scalability and practicality for low-data industrial visual inspection systems.

# Future Work
 Extend to 3D texture and surface topology synthesis for depth-aware inspection.
 Integrate diffusion–GAN hybrid models for sharper texture realism.
 Evaluate transferability to other industrial domains (e.g., textiles, PCB, automotive).
